# Data Science Exercise 
## In this git repo, I uploaded three data science projects; Employee retention, Pricing optimization, and Machine faulty detection. All works have done in Jupyter notebook. 

Please go to the project folder that you would like to look at. Each folder has 
 1. one README file 
 2. data file(s) for the project
 3. a Jupyter notebook for data science outcome
