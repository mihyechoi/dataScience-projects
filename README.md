# Data Science Exercise 
### In this git repo, I uploaded two data science projects (stay tuned for more to come!); Employee retention and Pricing optimization. All works have done in Jupyter notebook. 

Please go to the project folder that you would like to look at. Each folder has 
 1. one README file 
 2. data file(s) for the project
 3. a Jupyter notebook for data science outcome
