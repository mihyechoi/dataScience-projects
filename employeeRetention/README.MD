# Employee Retention (updated: 1.6.2021)

## Goal: to predict employee retention by understanding the main drivers of employee churn.

### Insight Data Science  

The data is employee data from a few companies. It includes all employees who joined from 2011/01/24 to 2015/12/13 with general information, such as average salary during her tenure, department, and years of experience. 

The columns are:

employee_id : id of the employee. Unique by employee per company

company_id : company id.

dept : employee department

seniority : number of yrs of work experience when hired

salary: average yearly salary of the employee during her tenure within the company

join_date: when the employee joined the company, it can only be between 2011/01/24 and 2015/12/13

quit_date: when the employee left her job (if she is still employed as of 2015/12/13, this field is NA)

In this exercise, I will focus on (1) finding the main factors that drive employee churn and (2) suggesting follow-up actions.
